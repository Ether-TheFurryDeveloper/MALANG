# MALANG
**MALANG** is an *Esolang* (or an ***Esoteric Programming Language***) that is designed to make you rage even though it only has **5 Keywords.** These are: **prt, add, sub, mul and div.** The thing that will make you rage the most is that it *doesn't* support any datatype except **int** and everything has to have its own variable, so you can't just type "add-1-2", that won't work, you need to first make a variable for both and then you can add:

**x-1**

**y-2**

**add-x-y**

that will output 3. then, even worse... the add, sub, mul or div keyword automatically prints it out, so you can't store it inside a variable. so this isn't valid:

**x-1**

**y-2**

**z-add-x-y (this does not work)**

this language was also made entirely by AI, i just made the syntax. The syntax does not use spaces, instead uses dashes.
# Enjoy MALANG!
